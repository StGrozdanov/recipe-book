## Mobile Admin Panel Client

This client is made with React Native. I choosed this framework because i wanted to have multiplatform support - both for Android and iOS, since i am using Android device, my girlfriend - iOS device. We both manage this application so React Native was the way to go. The application also supports dark and white themes.

- Expo

Expo is the perfect development enviorement for me. It connects your mobile device directly to the code, letting you use something real, that you develop for, instead of emulator. Also you can deploy your app in very convenient way and grants alot of extra goodies for development.

- Font Awesome

Font Awesome has support for react native applications. Very handy.

- React Navigation

Routing and navigation engine.

- Native Notify 

Library for mobile push notifications. It makes your life reaaaally easy with this.

- React Native Async Storage

A way to persist information into the application.

- React Native Chart Kit

This is the react native version of the chart JS library i used in the main client.
